Assign navigation menus from the main site in a WordPress multisite network to theme locations in sub-sites.


## Description 

Network Nav Menus allows you to designate a menu from the main site in a WordPress multisite network as the networked menu and it will appear as an available menu in your sub-sites.


## Installation 

This plugin works off of the `register_nav_menus` function. [For more on that function info see the Theme Developer Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/navigation-menus/) register nav menus page on the developer handbook"

You set up your menu array in your function file of the theme(s) you have in your themes folder the same way you would on for a single site install For example:
`register_nav_menus( array( 'global' => 'Global Navigation Menu' )`

Then you would call that menu on each theme file you want.

 `wp_nav_menu( array( 'theme_location' => 'header-menu' )`

Once you have created the the menu you want to use for your Network Nav Menu, you can then designate it as the menu you want for the Network Nav Menu from the list of available menus in the primary site.

You can then go to any sub-site under **Appearance > Menus** and there will be another menu option called "Network Menus." 

1. Upload **Network-Nav-Menus** to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
